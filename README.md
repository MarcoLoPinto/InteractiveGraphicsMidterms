# Interactive Graphics Midterms

Midterms 1 and 2 for the Interactive Graphics 2021 course.

Online Tuesday May 11th, 2021 <br>
Deadline: Sunday June 6th, 2021 (11.59pm, Rome time zone).

To test midterm1: host a server on the root folder and open the "Homework1.html" file for the first midterm.

Open the "Homework2.html" file for the second midterm.

The final project (3D First-Person Shooter with enemies, doors, stairs, explosives and more) can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/PasSilvestri/final-project-beatstep).

## Some of the concepts I've Learned and Applied

### **Graphics Programming Fundamentals**
   - The basics of graphics systems and the graphics pipeline.
   - Understanding how transformations, viewing and camera are computed and applied.
   - The role of shaders in modern graphics programming.
   - Understanding in detail: Vertex Processor, Clipper, Primitive Assembler, Rasterizer and Fragment Processor.

### **OpenGL and WebGL**
   - How to use OpenGL and WebGL for creating interactive graphics applications.
   - Practical implementations of 2D and 3D graphics applications.
   - Techniques for animation and texture mapping.

### **Shader Programming**
   - Learning the GLSL language.
   - Writing vertex and fragment shaders.
   - The importance of lights (point vs distributed sources, color properties and so on) and shading models in rendering.
   - Per vertex and per fragment lighting
   - Utilizing GPU programming to enhance graphics performance.

### **Advanced Rendering Techniques**
   - Exploring particle systems, shadow mapping, and ray tracing.
   - Implementations of advanced lighting and shading techniques.
   - Application of real-time rendering methods.

### **Mathematics for Computer Graphics**
   - Linear algebra essentials, such as vectors and matrices, crucial for computer graphics.
   - Transformations, projections matrices, coordinate systems, and their application in scene rendering.
   - Computational geometry for complex scene processing.
